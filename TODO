— create a function for converting arm-based data set to a contrast-based format (see the function ‘pairwise’ in the netmeta package)

- add methods for inspection and for checking convergence (see the coda package)

- change the package name (netmetaCopula or netmetaC?)

- replace ‘mcmplots’ package for plotting MCMC results with ‘ggmcmc’
